In the three short years since it's been open, the 5,000 square foot space has hosted club nights, live shows, experimental classical concerts and much more, becoming one of the most sought after venues in London. From an unassuming entrance, the club opens up into a cavernous warehouse loft with a state of the art d&b audiotechnik sound system and two outdoor terraces. With floor to ceiling glass windows along one side and an uninterrupted view looking out onto the behemoth decommissioned gas works, watching the sun rise over the industrial landscape in East London has become an iconic clubbing experience.",
